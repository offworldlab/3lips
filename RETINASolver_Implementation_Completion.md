# RETINASolver Integration - Completion Instructions

## Status: Core Integration COMPLETE âœ…

The RETINASolver has been successfully integrated into 3lips with all renaming from TelemetrySolver completed. The integration is functional and ready for testing phases.

## What's Complete:

### âœ… Phase 1: Module Analysis (COMPLETE)
- Analyzed RETINASolver implementation and API
- Identified correct function names: `get_initial_guess`, `solve_position_velocity_3d`
- Confirmed data format compatibility with 3lips

### âœ… Phase 2: Integration Wrapper (COMPLETE)  
- Created `RETINASolverLocalisation.py` wrapper class
- Implemented data conversion between 3lips and RETINASolver formats
- Added error handling and logging

### âœ… Phase 3: Docker Integration (COMPLETE)
- Updated docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.dev.yml volume mounts
- Changed from `../TelemetrySolver:/app/TelemetrySolver` to `../RETINAsolver:/app/RETINAsolver`
- Updated sys.path.append to `/app/RETINAsolver`

### âœ… Complete Rename: TelemetrySolver â†’ RETINASolver (COMPLETE)
- Renamed class file to `RETINASolverLocalisation.py`
- Updated class name to `RETINASolverLocalisation`
- Changed algorithm ID from "telemetry-solver" to "retina-solver"
- Updated all imports and variable names in event.py
- Updated Docker volume mount paths
- All print statements and comments updated

## Remaining Work - Next Steps:

### Phase 4: Integration Testing ðŸ”„
**Priority: HIGH**

1. **Create Integration Tests**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jonnyspicer/repos/retina/3lips-telemetry-solver
   
   # Create test file for RETINASolver integration
   mkdir -p tests/unit/event/localisation
   
   # Add test for RETINASolverLocalisation class
   # Test data conversion, error handling, solver integration
   ```

2. **Test with 3lips Data Format**
   ```bash
   # Use existing test data from save/ directory
   # Validate RETINASolver works with real radar detection format
   # Test algorithm selection: localisation_id = "retina-solver"
   ```

3. **End-to-End Pipeline Test**
   ```bash
   # Test: radar detections â†’ association â†’ RETINASolver â†’ tracker
   # Verify output format matches other localization algorithms
   ```

### Phase 5: Real Radar Testing ðŸ”„  
**Priority: HIGH**

1. **Development Environment Testing**
   ```bash
   # Start development environment
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
   
   # Configure to use RETINASolver
   # Set localisation_id = "retina-solver" in configuration
   
   # Monitor logs for RETINASolver processing
   docker logs -f 3lips-event
   ```

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Compare RETINASolver accuracy vs existing algorithms
   - Benchmark processing speed
   - Test with various detection scenarios (3+ radars)

3. **Error Handling Validation**
   - Test with insufficient detections (< 3 radars)
   - Test with invalid radar configurations
   - Verify graceful fallback behavior

### Phase 6: Production Readiness ðŸ”„
**Priority: MEDIUM**

1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README.md to include RETINASolver algorithm
   - Document configuration options
   - Add example usage

2. **Configuration Enhancement**
   ```bash
   # Add RETINASolver-specific environment variables to .env
   # Example:
   # RETINA_SOLVER_MAX_ITERATIONS=100
   # RETINA_SOLVER_CONVERGENCE_THRESHOLD=1e-6
   ```

3. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Enhanced error reporting
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Integration with existing 3lips monitoring

## Current Branch State:

- **Branch**: `issue-22-telemetry-solver-integration` 
- **Directory**: `/Users/jonnyspicer/repos/retina/3lips-telemetry-solver` (git worktree)
- **Last Commit**: Renamed TelemetrySolver to RETINASolver throughout codebase

## Testing Commands:

```bash
# Navigate to worktree
cd /Users/jonnyspicer/repos/retina/3lips-telemetry-solver

# Run unit tests
docker exec -it 3lips-event python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Start development environment
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Run integration tests (after system start)
./tests/verify-services.sh
# Then use Claude Code with Puppeteer MCP for full test suite
```

## Configuration for RETINASolver:

To use RETINASolver as the localization algorithm, set in your event configuration:
```json
{
  "localisation_id": "retina-solver"
}
```

The RETINASolver requires:
- Minimum 3 radar detections per target
- Valid radar configurations with tx/rx positions
- Bistatic range and Doppler measurements

## Files Modified in Integration:

1. `docker-compose.yml` - Updated volume mount to RETINAsolver
2. `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Updated volume mount to RETINAsolver  
3. `event/algorithm/localisation/RETINASolverLocalisation.py` - Main integration class
4. `event/event.py` - Added import and algorithm selection logic

## Next Claude Code Session:

When resuming work, start with:

```bash
cd /Users/jonnyspicer/repos/retina/3lips-telemetry-solver
git status
# Continue with Phase 4: Integration Testing
```

The core integration is complete and functional. Focus should now be on comprehensive testing and validation to ensure production readiness.
